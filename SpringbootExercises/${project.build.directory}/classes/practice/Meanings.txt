// dependency injection can be achieved through IOC and IOC says that a framework such as spring will provide dependencies required
so that the user need not worry about creating those dependencies or objects

IOC COntainer usually is responsible for creating configuring and managing the bean lifecycle once created the beans can be stored in
either the beanfactory or application context

Bean Factory            vs     Application Context

BeanFactory - provides lazy initialization of beans means once when there is a request to create a bean of a class it will create spring bean
Application Context - Eager Initializtion of beans will be done by this meaning as soon as the applicaton starts up the spring framework
will store the beans in application context. also, Application context extends the BeanFactory hence, all the features supported by the
BeanFactory will be inherited by Application Context also internalization and some advance features of spring framework will be
supported by the Application Context.
